Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {â€œaâ€:{â€œbâ€:{â€œcâ€:â€dâ€}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {â€œxâ€:{â€œyâ€:{â€œzâ€:â€aâ€}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
